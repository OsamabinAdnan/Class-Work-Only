//Type casting is a feature in TypeScript that allows developers to explicitly change the type of a value from one type to another. 
//Type casting is particularly useful when you're working with dynamic data, or when the type of a value is not correctly inferred automatically.
let myname = "Zia";
console.log(myname.length);
console.log(myname.length);
//casting (data type)
let value = "Osama bin Adnan";
console.log(value.length, value.toUpperCase(), value.toLocaleLowerCase());
