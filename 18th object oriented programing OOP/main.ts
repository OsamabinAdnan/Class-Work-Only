/*Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm centered around objects and classes. 
It organizes code into reusable, self-contained modules that model real-world entities, making it easier to design, manage, and maintain complex software systems.
till now we are doing functional programming
OOP is a paradigm of all programming JS, Java, C+, C sharp etc.
Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm centered around the concept of "objects," which can contain data in the form of fields (attributes or properties) and code in the form of procedures (methods). 
OOP emphasizes the principles of encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism. 
OOP enhances code modularity, readability, and maintainability.
                                                ================Pillars of OOP================
1) Encapsulation:
Bundles data (attributes) and methods (functions) that operate on the data into a single unit called a class.
Controls access to the data and protects it from unauthorized modifications using access modifiers (public, private, protected).
Encapsulation involves bundling the data and methods that operate on the data within a single unit or class.

2) Abstraction:
Simplifies complex systems by providing a clear, simplified interface while hiding the complex implementation details.
Allows focusing on interactions at a higher level without needing to understand the underlying workings.

3)Inheritance:
Allows a new class (subclass) to inherit attributes and methods from an existing class (superclass), promoting code reuse.
Supports hierarchical relationships and enables the creation of a more specific class based on a general one.
Inheritance allows new classes to inherit properties and methods from existing ones, promoting code reuse.

4)Polymorphism:
Enables objects of different classes to be treated as objects of a common superclass.
Supports method overriding and method overloading, allowing for flexible and dynamic method calls based on the object's actual class.
Polymorphism enables methods to process objects differently based on their data type or class.

5) Classes:
Organizes code into reusable, self-contained modules.
Helps in better organization and maintainability of large and complex software systems.
It is defining of the blue print ==> Classes used to make object, Classes name should be capital letter
Variable in classes are called class properties or fields

6) Object:
Instances of classes are known as objects. Each object has its own state and behavior defined by the class.

  /*We have a feature of contructor, it is a class function in which you can define parameter
Syntax contructor () {
}
class properties and contructor parameter could have same names
Whenever we want to use class properties then we use "this" KW
"new" KW is used to make object and call contructor function as well in argument
Class properties are not fix but change due to the introduction of contructor | for example const P1 = new Person ("Ahmed", 30)
